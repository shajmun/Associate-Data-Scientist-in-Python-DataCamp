# Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the history of the Nobel Prize using Python. By exploring a dataset of laureates from 1901 to the present day, I identified patterns in demographics, nationality dominance over time, and gender representation across different categories.

The goal was to answer questions like: "Who wins the Nobel Prize?", "Is the prize diversifying?", and "Which countries have dominated different eras?"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `pandas` (Data Manipulation)
    * `seaborn` & `matplotlib` (Data Visualization)
    * `numpy` (Numerical operations)

## Key Findings & Insights
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I discovered several interesting trends:

1.  **Dominant Demographics:**
    * The most commonly awarded gender is **Male**.
    * The most common birth country is the **United States of America**.

2.  **US Dominance:**
    * The United States had its highest ratio of winners in the **2000s**, dominating the global stage during that decade.

3.  **Female Representation:**
    * The category and decade combination with the highest proportion of female laureates was **Literature in the 2020s**.
    * **Marie Curie** was identified as the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize (Physics).

4.  **Repeat Winners:**
    * Identified prestigious individuals and organizations that have won multiple times, including the **International Committee of the Red Cross**, **Linus Pauling**, and **Marie Curie**.
